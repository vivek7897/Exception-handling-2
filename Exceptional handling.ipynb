      "source": "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\nNote: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions. \nANs - 1. Standardized Behavior and Integration\nConsistency: By extending the Exception class, your custom exception adheres to the standard exception handling mechanism provided by the language. This ensures that it behaves consistently with other exceptions in terms of how it is thrown, caught, and handled.\nCompatibility: Most programming languages and their libraries expect exceptions to be derived from a base exception class. This compatibility ensures that your custom exception can be integrated seamlessly with existing code and frameworks.\n2. Inheritance of Core Functionality\nBase Functionality: The Exception class provides core functionalities that are essential for exception handling, such as the ability to capture a stack trace, store an error message, and optionally include a cause. By extending Exception, your custom exception inherits these functionalities, which are crucial for debugging and error reporting.\nCustomizable Behavior: While you get the core functionality, you also have the ability to add additional features or override existing methods to suit your specific needs.\n3. Clarity and Semantics\nClear Intent: Extending Exception (or a derived class such as RuntimeException or IOException in Java) clearly indicates that your class is intended to be used as an exception. This makes your code more readable and understandable to other developers who may be working with it.\nSemantic Meaning: Using the Exception base class helps convey that your class represents an exceptional condition that should be handled or reported, fitting the semantics of exception handling in the language.\n4. Handling and Propagation\nException Handling Mechanism: The exception handling mechanisms provided by the language (such as try-catch blocks) are designed to work with instances of classes derived from the base Exception class. By extending Exception, your custom exception can be caught and handled appropriately within these mechanisms.\nException Propagation: Custom exceptions derived from the base Exception class can be thrown and propagated up the call stack, allowing higher-level code to handle them or convert them into more general exceptions if needed.\nIn summary, extending the Exception class or its derived classes is important for ensuring that your custom exception integrates properly with the language’s exception handling system, inherits useful functionality, and conveys the correct semantic meaning of an exceptional condition.\n\n\n\nQ2. Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n\nimport inspect\nimport builtins\n\ndef print_exception_hierarchy(cls, indent=0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively prints the hierarchy of exceptions starting from cls.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(' ' * indent + cls.__name__)\n    for subclass in cls.__subclasses__():\n        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\n\ndef main():\n    # Start from the base exception class\n    base_exception = builtins.BaseException\n    print(\"Python Exception Hierarchy:\")\n    print_exception_hierarchy(base_exception)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nQ3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n\nhe ArithmeticError class is a base class for all errors related to arithmetic operations. It is a subclass of the built-in Exception class and provides a common base for various specific arithmetic-related exceptions. The primary errors defined under the ArithmeticError class include:\n\nZeroDivisionError \nOverflowError\nFloatingPointError\n\nZeroDivisionError\ntry:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\n2. OverflowError\n\nimport math\n\ntry:\n    result = math.exp(1000)  # Exponentiation of a large number\nexcept OverflowError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n\nQ4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n\nhe LookupError class in Python is a base class for exceptions raised during failed lookups in collections. It allows for general handling of lookup-related errors. Examples include:\nKeyError: Raised when accessing a non-existent dictionary key.\nIndexError: Raised when accessing an out-of-range index in a seque\n Definition: ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find a module or its attributes.\n\nDefinition: ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find a module or its attributes.\n\nDefinition: ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find a module or its attributes.\n\nQ5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n\nImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find a module or its attributes.\nModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError introduced in Python 3.6. It is specifically raised when a module cannot be found during an import operation.\n\nQ6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n\nEffective exception handling is crucial for writing robust and maintainable Python code. Here are some best practices:\n\n1. Use Specific Exceptions\nPrefer specific exceptions over general ones to handle known error conditions explicitly. For example, use FileNotFoundError rather than the broad Exception class.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ntry:\n    with open('file.txt') as f:\n        content = f.read()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"File not found.\")\n2. Avoid Catching All Exceptions\nDo not use a bare except: clause, as it catches all exceptions, including system-exiting ones like KeyboardInterrupt. This can hide bugs and make debugging difficult.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ntry:\n    # code\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n3. Handle Exceptions at the Appropriate Level\nHandle exceptions at the level where you can properly address them. Avoid catching exceptions too early or too late in the code.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ndef process_data():\n    try:\n        # process data\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Value error: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    process_data()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unhandled exception: {e}\")\n4. Use Finally for Cleanup\nUse the finally block to ensure that cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception occurs, such as closing files or releasing resources.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ntry:\n    file = open('file.txt', 'r')\n    # read from file\nexcept IOError as e:\n    print(f\"IO error: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    file.close()\n5. Log Exceptions\nLog exceptions instead of printing them. Use Python’s logging module to record exception details for future debugging.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n\ntry:\n    # code\nexcept Exception as e:\n    logging.error(\"An error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n6. Raise Exceptions with Descriptive Messages\nProvide meaningful messages when raising exceptions to make debugging easier.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n    return a / b\n7. Avoid Empty Except Blocks\nDo not use empty except blocks as they can hide errors. Always handle exceptions properly or log them.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ntry:\n    # code\nexcept SomeException:\n    pass  # Avoid this\n8. Use Custom Exceptions\nCreate custom exceptions for specific error conditions in your application. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\nclass CustomError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ntry:\n    raise CustomError(\"Something went wrong.\")\nexcept CustomError as e:\n    print(f\"Custom error occurred: {e}\")\n9. Avoid Overusing Exceptions for Control Flow\nDo not use exceptions for normal control flow; they should be reserved for truly exceptional situations.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\n# Use conditionals instead of exceptions for control flow\nif condition:\n    # normal flow\nelse:\n    # exceptional situation\n10. Document Exceptions in Functions\nDocument which exceptions a function might raise in the docstring to help users of the function understand what to expect.\nExample:\npython\nCopy code\ndef read_file(filename):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a file and returns its contents.\n\n    :param filename: Path to the file\n    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist\n    :return: File contents as a string\n    \"\"\"\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        return file.read()",
